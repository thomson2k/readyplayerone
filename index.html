      <h1 class="first"> INTRODUCTION</h1>
      <p>READY PLAYER ONE is a book that brings two different media—videogames
				and literature—together into a crazy 3D explosion (in your mind!).
				 Plus, it bridges the generation gap between the 1980s and now,
				 putting all of those pictures of your parents (or yourself) in neon
				  leg-warmers, side-ponytails, and way too many accessories into context.
					 But get this: Ready Player One not only gets its inspiration from the games
					 <img src="img/Ready-player-One1.jpg" id="box"/>
					  of the '80s, but the movies and music, too. This is a book with a retro,
						 synthesized soundtrack and a breakneck adventure plot straight out of your
						 favorite classic movies, like Indiana Jones, Star Wars, and Ladyhawke. Okay,
						  they might not all be classics, but they're beloved by many, especially by
							super-geek author Ernest Cline.

				 Published in 2011, Ready Player One is Ernest Cline's
				 love letter to the eighties—the decade he grew up in—and
				 all its celebrities, culture, and awesome gaming action.
				 It follows Wade Watts, a teenager in 2045, and his quest
				 for fame and fortune. He's hooked on the OASIS, an uber-realistic
				  MMO game that has taken the world by storm. Its deceased creator,
					 James Halliday, has put his entire estate up as the prize for a
					 contest that requires fast reflexes, a great memory for film quotes,
					  and an encyclopedic knowledge of 1980s trivia. Are you game? If you
						're a full-fledged geek or even just a geek at heart, what are you
						waiting for? Pick up Ready Player One today and start the adventure. The OASIS is waiting.

      <h1 class="second">0001</h1>
      <p>It's the year 2044, and the real world has bewine an ugly place. We're out of oil. We've wrecked the climate. Famine, poverty and disease are widespread.
				Like most of humanity, Wade Watts escapes this depressing reality by spending his waking hours jacked into the OASIS, a sprawling virtual utopia where you can be anything you want to be, where you can live and play and fall in love on any of ten thousand planets. And like most of humanity, Wade is obsessed by the ultimate lottery ticket that lies concealed within this alternate reality: OASIS founder James Halliday, who dies with no heir, has promised that control of the OASIS — and his massive fortune — will go to thc person who can solve the riddles he has left scattered throughout his crration.
				For years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing only that the riddles arc based on Halliday's obsession with 80s pop culture. And then Wade stumbles onto the key to the first puzzle. Suddenly, he finds himself pitted against thousands of competitors in a desperate race to claim the ultimate prize, a chase that soon takes on terrifying real-world dimensions — and that will leave both Wade and his world profoundly changed.  </p>
    <h1 class="third">Characters</h1>
			 <h1>WADE OWEN WATTS A.K.A. PARZIVAL</h1>
      <p>Meet our narrator, Wade Owen Watts: initials W.O.W.
				Wow, that's a great name for a superhero, isn't it? He's the hero of our story, and like most superheroes, he had a tragic upbringing right out of the most melodramatic afterschool special. Wade's father was shot dead while looting a store, and his mother, the OASIS's version of a phone-sex operator, died of a drug overdose. Wade's also socially awkward and overweight, a double kiss of death on the road to
				<img src="img/herorpo.png" id="img" alt="Avatar">friendlessness. No wonder the kid has a need to escape into the OASIS, the MMO game so real that it makes you forget reality.Without friends or family, Wade finds other passions: namely videogames, music, and movies of the 1980s. He's obsessed with James Halliday's legacy, and falls in love with everything Halliday did. His obsessions make him a mini-me of Halliday in a way, a strange recluse who thinks everyone should love what he does. Does Wade know he's imitating his idol? And why is this creepy old dude his idol anyway? Could it have something to do with the fact that Wade lacks a father figure? Or is he just the world's biggest fanboy?
			</p>
			<h1>JAMES HALLIDAY</h1>
			<p>It's speculated that he had Asperger's syndrome or lay somewhere on the autism spectrum, but this theory isn't really explored further in the book. Whatever the reason, his self-imposed isolation ended up giving him the time and motivation to invent the OASIS and the greatest treasure hunt the world has ever seen. So though he's gone, his impact on the book is pretty big.</p>
